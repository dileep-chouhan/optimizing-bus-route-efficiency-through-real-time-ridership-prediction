# Optimizing Bus Route Efficiency through Real-Time Ridership Prediction

**Overview**

This project aims to optimize public bus route efficiency and reduce operational costs by leveraging real-time ridership prediction.  The analysis utilizes historical ridership data to build predictive models capable of forecasting passenger demand at various times and locations.  These predictions enable dynamic adjustments to service frequency, leading to improved resource allocation and a more efficient public transportation system.

**Technologies Used**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


**How to Run**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output**

The script will print key performance indicators (KPIs) to the console, including model accuracy metrics and predicted ridership for specific time intervals.  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., `ridership_predictions.png`, `route_efficiency.png`) showcasing predicted ridership trends and the impact of dynamic adjustments on route efficiency.  These plots are saved in the `output` directory.  The specific outputs and visualizations may vary depending on the input data and model parameters.


**Data**

The project requires a dataset containing historical bus ridership data.  This data should include at minimum:

* Timestamps of ridership events
* Route ID
* Location (e.g., stop ID)
* Number of passengers
